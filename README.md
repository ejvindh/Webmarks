Webmarks - Android
===================

An app to collect all your Bookmarks on the web.

If you use various browsers it can be helpful with one app to collect all your bookmarks -- then Webmarks is your friend.

* I will not publish this app on Google Play, since I'm against having to pay for helping Google improve their system. In order to install it, you will thus have to do this:

1) Accept installation from "unknown sources": That is done in "Settings" -- "Security" (after having installed this app, I recommend that you remove the checkmark again).

2) Download and install the apk-file found here:
